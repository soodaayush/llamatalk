## Inspiration

Iâ€™ve always wanted a personal chatbot that runs locally, something private, responsive, and customizable. When I discovered Ollama, which makes running LLMs locally super straightforward, I decided to build a minimal front-end that lets anyone interact with an LLM through a browser interface.

## Challenges

- Establishing a reliable connection between the front-end and the local LLM service
- Properly formatting the request and parsing the LLM's response
- Ensuring a seamless user experience with fast, local responses

## Lessons Learned

- How to run and interact with local LLMs via Ollama
- Sending and receiving JSON data using `fetch` in JavaScript
- Handling response objects and dynamically updating the UI
- Customizing models and experimenting with local inference setups

## The Website

LlamaTalk is a simple, sleek interface for chatting with locally hosted LLMs via Ollama. Powered by Meta's CodeLlama, LlamaTalk lets you ask questions and get intelligent responses, all while keeping everything on your own machine.
