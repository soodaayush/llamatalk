## Inspiration

I wanted to make my very own local chatbot with an interface.

## Challenges

Connecting the LLM to the website itself.

## The Website

A chatbot powered by Meta's Codellama. As of now, you must run the LLM locally through a service called Ollama. You can customize which model you can use depending upon the number of parameters.
